# PINGCAP PRIVACY POLICY

*Effective Date:* October 10, 2018

PingCAP obtains and uses personal information about individuals to enhance our ability to deliver the highest level of service, but we also recognize that you expect us to treat this information appropriately. This privacy policy explains how PingCAP uses, shares and protects personal information that it collects on pingcap.com and any related mobile applications and websites operated by PingCAP ("Site").

By visiting the Site or purchasing, enrolling in or using our product and services, you agree to this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service).

## The Sources of Information

PingCAP collects personal information from you in various ways, including when you visit the Site, create an account with us, purchase, enroll in and use our programs, participate in our social media communities, such as on Twitter, and when you send us feedback.

The personal information we collect about you personally may include:

  - Your name and contact details;
  - Company name;
  - Course and training module enrollments, course access dates/times and course completion data;
  - Your stated and inferred interests;
  - Credit card details;
  - Your activity on the Site, both in terms of transactions (such as order history) and in terms of otherwise interacting with the Site (e.g., behavioral patterns such as your consumption of content, purchase of products/services available through the Site, and other data and analytics)
  
## Cookies and Automatic Collection of Data

"Cookies" are small text files that may be placed on your web browser when you visit our Site. You can, of course, disable cookies and web beacons on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. If you opt not to accept cookies, you may not be able to benefit from the full features of our site. Some of the cookies we use are automatically deleted from your hard drive after the end of the browser session (session cookies). We also use cookies that remain on your hard drive for a certain period of time (between one day and five years, depending on the cookie) after the browser session. When you revisit our site, it may automatically recall the country and language you selected at your last visit to our Site. These "persistent cookies" are stored on your hard drive and will be deleted by the browser after the given time.

We may also use web beacons, and other technologies, to help track whether our communications are reaching you, to measure their effectiveness, or to collect certain non-personal information about your computer, device, or browser in order to allow us to better design future communications to you. "Clickstream" data (e.g., information regarding which of our Web pages you access, the frequency of such access, and your product and service preferences) may be collected by PingCAP itself, or by our service providers, using cookies, Web beacons, page tags, or similar tools that are set when you visit our Site or when you view an advertisement we have placed on another website. Clickstream data and similar information may be used: for administrative purposes; to assess the usage, value and performance of our online products and services; to provide you with information concerning products and services offered by PingCAP; to improve your experience with our Site; and as otherwise permitted by applicable law or regulation. If you are a PingCAP client, this information helps us suggest products or service offerings that may be of interest to you. This information may be processed by us for the purposes described above, or on our behalf by third parties, solely in accordance with our instructions.

When you visit this site, your browser may be momentarily directed to the website of an ad server or other third party service provider. This re-direction process will not be apparent to you. These third party websites automatically receive your IP address when this happens, and they may also collect information from your interaction with our Site including computer and connection information, standard web log information, and ad information. Such information does not identify you individually.

Some web browsers and devices permit you to broadcast a preference that you not be “tracked” online. We do not modify your online experience based upon whether such a signal is broadcast.

## Our Use of Your Personal Information

We may use your personal information for multiple internal and external purposes, including but not limited to:

  - Administering, facilitating and managing your relationship and/or account with PingCAP.
  - Providing the service or product requested;
  - Analyzing and reporting on your and other participants’ performance;
  - Providing you with information about related products and services, based on the preferences you have indicated;
  - Improving our Site;
  - Developing new products and services;
  - Administering PingCAP’s systems and troubleshooting purposes; and
  - Facilitating our internal business operations, including assessing and managing risk and fulfilling our legal and regulatory requirements.
  
If your relationship with PingCAP ends, PingCAP will continue to treat your personal information, to the extent we retain it, as described in this policy.

For United States residents, we undertake marketing only in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and other applicable law.  For European Union residents, we undertake marketing only with your express affirmative consent and in compliance with applicable data privacy laws.  EU residents will not be added to the marketing lists unless they have already provided express affirmative consent consistent with applicable data protection laws.

## Disclosures of Your Personal Information to Third Parties

PingCAP does not share personal information with unaffiliated third parties for those third parties’ own purposes. PingCAP may, however, share personal information with our third party service providers, agents, contractors, or partners in connection with services that these individuals or entities perform for, or with PingCAP.

Third Parties that assist PingCAP in providing services to you are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information to the extent they receive it and to use your personal information only in the course of providing such services to PingCAP and only for the purposes that PingCAP dictates.

PingCAP may also disclose your personal information to investigate, establish, and protect PingCAP’s legal rights and interests or pursuant to your express consent. Under limited circumstances, your personal information may be disclosed to third parties as permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations; for instance, when responding to a subpoena or similar legal process, to protect against fraud and to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or regulatory authorities.

We may transfer or share a copy of personal information about you in the event that PingCAP or one of its assets, affiliates, or subsidiaries goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, being reorganized or liquidated, or by selling a portion of its assets. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of PingCAP to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever. PingCAP specifically reserves the right to transfer or share a copy of personally identifiable information collected from its Site to the buyer of that portion of its business relating to that information during any diligence process.

## Data Quality, Storage, and Access

While we make every effort to ensure that all information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up to date, you can help us by promptly notifying us if there are any changes to your personal information.

We store personal information for different periods of time consistent with the purposes for which they were originally collected, as subsequently further authorized, or when required or allowed under applicable law.

## California Privacy Rights

Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties or corporate affiliates for their direct marketing purposes.

## EU Data Protection Rights

Individuals in Europe have certain data subject rights which may be subject to limitations and/or restrictions. These rights may include the right to: (i) request access to and rectification or erasure of their personal data; (ii) obtain restriction of processing or to object to processing of their personal data; and (iii) the right to data portability. Individuals in Europe may also have the right to lodge a complaint about the processing of their personal data with their local data protection authority.  You can contact us at the information provided below.

You may be required to supply a valid means of identification as a security precaution to assist us in preventing the unauthorized disclosure of your personal information. We will process your request within the time provided by applicable law.

Individuals in Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, Uruguay, and certain other jurisdictions may also exercise these or similar rights.

## Dispute Resolution

If you believe that PingCAP may be processing data about you and wish to have access to that information, we can provide you with that data or at least an explanation of why we cannot do so in the particular context, such as if responding to the request would be unreasonably expensive.

Please also let us know if you have any questions, concerns, disputes, or issues. We are always open to dialogue to resolve issues. If your concerns cannot be resolved, we can enter into appropriate third-party neutral dispute resolution. If you need to reach us about a privacy or data protection issue, please contact us using the contact information below.
